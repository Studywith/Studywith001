## DAY3-3 那么我们会流落街头吗

失业是否意味着失去收入或者只能获得微薄的救济呢？不，在未来你其实不必担心收入的问题。我先列举以下的事实：

* 在德国，一个穆斯林难民每个月可以获得住处和392欧元的现金（或选择食品、水电、衣物、生活用品和143欧元现金）
* 无条件基本工资 Universal Basic Income：
  * TEDx的一个介绍 [链接](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av4618385/?from=search&seid=14802677454932633704)
  * 另一个针对技术性失业的UBI介绍 [链接](https://futurism.com/images/universal-basic-income-answer-automation/)
  * 2016年瑞士已经进行一次针对UBI的全民公决，虽然未被通过

关于无差别基本收入的概念

这一段TED演讲比较清楚的阐述了这个计划的基本背景和原理

**为什么需要了解**

希望这个可以给你的未来带来不错的基础安全感。

我們的社會是歷來最富裕的﹗我認為基本收入就是社會進步帶來的紅利。由於我們的祖先辛勤工作以達到今天的繁榮局面，我們才有本錢讓每個人從祖先的成就分一杯羹。各位記住：消滅貧窮說到底是一項投資。經濟學家曾計算過，必須動用大約1,750億美元才可徹底消滅美國的貧窮狀況。開支相當高昂，對吧﹖每年1,759億美元，但這只及美國軍費預算的四分之一，所以滅貧投資是絕對可能，也可行。

UBI（&nbsp;&nbsp;**Studywith小词条UBI**&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Universal Basic Income，全民无条件基本收入计划。很多国家在制定和实现的一种针对所有人的无条件基础月薪，是人工智能时代的一个重要的体制。也是我们本次介绍的一个很核心的内容。&nbsp;&nbsp;）当然是未来必然会发生的事情，面对超高失业率，政府不可能让失业者饿死，有人说羊毛出在羊身上，到头来还是老百姓埋单，错，当然是以很高比率采用机器人和人工智能的企业政府课以重税来埋单。

而且不要一位每个月这个钱只够你糊口，你的生活水平会比现在好的多。当然，一个现在的城市农民工也比1980年城里的普通家庭生活条件好得多得多，这并不代表“幸福感”会更高，这是个复杂问题。

有钱不幸福，比别人有钱才幸福

收入的平均水平与幸福有很大的相关性，这篇论文以长期的数据对比证明了这个趋势

**为什么需要了解**

UBI只是你最基础的安全感，但确实在任何意义上，都与你的幸福没有关系。

We investigated the relation between income inequality and
happiness over a 37-year period in the United States. As
predicted, Americans were on average less happy in years
with more societal income inequality than in years with
less societal income inequality. We demonstrated that the
negative association between societal income inequality and
individual-level happiness was explained by perceived fairness
and general trust. We also found that the negative association
between income disparity and happiness was present
among Americans with lower incomes but not among Americans
with higher incomes. Moreover, we showed that it was
not the reduced income but the lowered levels of perceived
fairness and trust that made low-income Americans feel less
happy in the years with greater income inequality.
Although there is a large body of research on income
inequality in other social and behavioral sciences (see
Wilkinson & Pickett, 2009, for a review), relatively few
researchers have investigated the role of income inequality in
psychological science. More important, the small body of
existing research on income inequality and happiness has not
examined any psychological mechanisms. To this end, our
mediation findings for the first time delineate the psychological
mechanisms linking a socioecological factor (income
inequality) with individual-level happiness, and therefore contribute
to the emerging topics in socioecological psychology
(Oishi & Graham, 2010; Oishi, Kesebir, & Snyder, 2009).
Social scientists have debated why Americans have not
become happier over the last 50 years despite the enormous
growth in national wealth (Easterlin, 1974). At first, researchers
assumed that economic growth was not associated with an
increase in individual happiness because of social-comparison
processes (other people’s wealth was also increasing), upward
shifts in aspirations, and hedonic adaptation (Easterlin, 1974).
Recently, however, researchers have found that economic
growth is in fact associated with an increase in happiness over
time in many nations other than the United States (Stevenson
& Wolfers, 2008). It has been unclear, however, why massive
economic growth over the past decades has translated to an
increase in happiness among the Danish, French, and Germans,
but not among Americans. The existing theories cannot
explain the anomaly of the United States, as an upward shift in
aspiration, hedonic adaptation, and social comparisons should
apply similarly to other nations with economic growth. Our
findings provide a novel clue for this puzzle. Income growth
without income disparity is likely to result in an increase in the
mean happiness of a general population. This new hypothesis
needs to be carefully tested in the future.
It is important to recognize four limitations of our research.
First, happiness, fairness, and general trust were each measured
by single items. Thus, measurement error is expected
to be far from trivial. Although researchers have used the
same single-item happiness (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade,
Schwarz, & Stone, 2006), fairness, and trust measures
(Kawachi et al., 1997), it is important to replicate the current
findings with better-validated multi-item scales. Second, we
examined only perceived fairness and general trust as potential
mediators. There might be other potential mediators that were
not measured in this study. Third, although we emphasized the
negative aspects of income inequality, there might be circumstances
under which income inequality reflects that individuals
who contribute more receive greater rewards. Furthermore, the
relation between societal income inequality and individual happiness
is likely to vary across time, nations, and political cultures
(e.g., Alesina et al., 2004; Napier & Jost, 2008).
In conclusion, Americans are happier when national wealth
is distributed more evenly than when it is distributed less evenly.
If the ultimate goal of society is to make its citizens happy
(Bentham, 1789/2008), then it is desirable to consider policies
that produce more income equality, fairness, and general trust
